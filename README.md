# Legacy Grafana Backend Plugins

This repository is for Grafana's old version of backend plugins. As of Grafana 7.0, backend plugins have been [updated and offically supported](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/developers/plugins/backend/). The new backend plugin SDK that replaces this is located at https://github.com/grafana/grafana-plugin-sdk-go.
